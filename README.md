## Scenario

Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in theglobal smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company.

## Prepare Phase 

This case study uses public FitBit Fitness Tracker Data. The dataset contains personal fitness tracker data from thirty fitbit users who consnented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps and heart rate, and thus can be used to explore users's habits. The data is made available by Mobius and can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit)

The data is made of up several datasets organized in either long or wide format. However, there are 2 key problems with the data. First, the data is not **recent** as it was collected in 2016. Second, the sample size is too small. Only data for **30** Fitbit users is available yet there are over **30 million** Fitbit users worldwide. 

Given these limitations, additional data is required and insights gained from analyzing available data shall not be taken as conclusive.
